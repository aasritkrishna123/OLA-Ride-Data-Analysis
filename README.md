## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Monitor **overall ride booking performance**
- Analyze **peak demand hours and days**
- Understand **trip distance and duration trends**
- Evaluate **revenue and fare behavior**
- Identify **cancellation and operational patterns**
- Deliver **interactive, stakeholder-ready dashboards**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

OLA operates at large scale with thousands of daily ride bookings.  
Business stakeholders require a **data-driven view of ride demand, revenue performance, trip behavior, and cancellations** to improve:

- Driver allocation  
- Operational efficiency  
- Revenue optimization  
- Customer experience  

The goal of this project is to **analyze historical OLA ride data** and transform it into **actionable insights and interactive dashboards** that support **data-driven decision-making**.

---

## 📦 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains ride-level operational data including:

- Booking ID  
- Ride Date & Time  
- Pickup & Drop Locations  
- Trip Distance  
- Trip Duration  
- Fare Amount  
- Ride Status (Completed / Cancelled)  

The data represents **real-world ride-hailing operations** and was processed using **SQL and Python** before visualization.
